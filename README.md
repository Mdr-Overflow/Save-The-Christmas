# Save-The-Christmas

Year I - Python - Project

What is it ?

The project "Save the Christmas" is an app designed to help Santa
Claus process every letter, keep track of every toy the elves make and
tracks every address he needs to get to.

How was it designed ?

The back-end of the project stack was designed in Python, and
achieved the primary tasks listed below, while the "User-interface" was
Web-based, a webpage which would share information about the
process ( such as the ) , and display a map which would contain "real
time" simulated information of Santa's whereabouts (trajectory
around the globe).

The program was designed by 3 large departments and a special 4th
that go as follows:

The "Reading letters" department had the role of reading the
received letters and forwarding only data that can be used for
making gifts (desired gift, favorite color, address, name);

The "Gift Making" department was divided into 3 subdivisions:
"Procurement", "Production" and "Packaging", which dealt with
gift materials, gift assembly and color of the packaging.
The "Gift Sharing" department was responsible for sending the
gifts around the world. The purpose was that the gifts arrive on
the exact date, so that every child could have their Christmas
presents on time.

The "Web" department which would ensure a user-friendly ,
"good-looking" interface with a user by designing and providing
the front end - webpage interface which each child could use to
view if their gifts were sent and track Santa.

What were my attributions?

I was the project lead for the "Gift Sharing" department. I provided:
-> Scheduling for brainstorming sessions over dividing activites to
all the students in said department;

-> Created and modeled task breakdown using UML for each subdivision;

-> Wrote the baseline code in Python while finding open source
resources to complete such a task; Helped the "Web"
department with the map component of the website;

-> Held meetings over a video platform with the leads of the other
departments and the assigned team leaders for each
subdivision of my department.
